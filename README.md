# Week-2-Challenge-
# Week-1-Challenge
This is the Challenge for Week 2 of the Bootcamp. Due date is the 19th December at 23:59. Due to time constraints, I was only able to upload this piece of work on the 29th December. I found this to be a challenging task to work around. I think my final output is okay visually, but there are some elements which I still need working on. Specifically, I need to dedicate more time to mastering flexbox and the different methods I can use to orient objects with css (justify-content etc). The purpose of this challenge was to increase my exposure to methods of aligning content with css. It also served as further training of the methods I learned from my first week, namely how to deploy websites on gitpages, how to create nav links, how to add images to sites etc. The one challenge I had specifically with this task was with media queries, as I couldn't get the site to resize as I wanted it to. I should dedicate a lot more time this week to fully understanding this concept before moving on. I also couldn't figure out how to resize the runbuddy image so that it would be the same as the others in its class. This also needs to be the focus of any upcoming work.
